	Abstract = {Complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strands in solution reliably hybridize to form stable duplexes. We study the kinetics of the hybridization process and the mechanisms by which two initially isolated strands come together to form a stable double helix. We adopt a multi-step computational approach. First, we perform a large number of Brownian dynamics simulations of the hybridization process using the coarse-grained oxDNA2 model. Second, we use these simulations to construct a Markov state model of DNA dynamics that uses a state decomposition based on the inter-strand hydrogen bonding pattern. Third, we take advantage of transition path theory to obtain quantitative information about the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the hybridization process. We find that while there is a large ensemble of possible hybridization pathways, there is a single dominant mechanism in which an initial base pair forms close to either end of the nascent double helix, and the remaining bases pair sequentially in a zipper-like fashion. We also show that the number of formed base pairs by itself is insufficient to describe the transition state of the hybridization process.},

@article{Bui2018,
	Abstract = {The field of DNA nanoscience has demonstrated many exquisite DNA nanostructures and intricate DNA nanodevices. However, the operation of each step of prior demonstrated DNA nanodevices requires the diffusion of DNA strands, and the speed of these devices is limited by diffusion kinetics. Here we demonstrate chains of localized DNA hybridization reactions on the surface of a self-assembled DNA origami rectangle. The localization design for our DNA nanodevices does not rely on the diffusion of DNA strands for each step, thus providing faster reaction kinetics. The locality also provides considerable increased scalability, since localized components of the devices can be reused in other locations. A variety of techniques, including atomic force microscopy, total internal reflection fluorescence, and ensemble fluorescence spectroscopy, are used to confirm the occurrence of localized DNA hybridization reactions on the surface of DNA origami. There are many potential biological applications for our localized DNA nanodevices, and the localization design is extensible to applications involving DNA nanodevices operating on other molecular surfaces, such as those of the cell.},

@article{Kick2012,
	Abstract = {Background: The molecular recognition based on the complementary base pairing of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the fundamental principle in the fields of genetics, DNA nanotechnology and DNA computing. We present an exhaustive DNA sequence design algorithm that allows to generate sets containing a maximum number of sequences with defined properties. EGNAS (Exhaustive Generation of Nucleic Acid Sequences) offers the possibility of controlling both interstrand and intrastrand properties. The guanine-cytosine content can be adjusted. Sequences can be forced to start and end with guanine or cytosine. This option reduces the risk of " fraying" of DNA strands. It is possible to limit cross hybridizations of a defined length, and to adjust the uniqueness of sequences. Self-complementarity and hairpin structures of certain length can be avoided. Sequences and subsequences can optionally be forbidden. Furthermore, sequences can be designed to have minimum interactions with predefined strands and neighboring sequences.Results: The algorithm is realized in a C++ program. TAG sequences can be generated and combined with primers for single-base extension reactions, which were described for multiplexed genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Thereby, possible foldback through intrastrand interaction of TAG-primer pairs can be limited. The design of sequences for specific attachment of molecular constructs to DNA origami is presented.Conclusions: We developed a new software tool called EGNAS for the design of unique nucleic acid sequences. The presented exhaustive algorithm allows to generate greater sets of sequences than with previous software and equal constraints.

@article{Markegard2016,
	Abstract = {A newly developed coarse-grained model called BioModi is utilized to elucidate the effects of temperature and concentration on DNA hybridization in self-assembly. Large-scale simulations demonstrate that complementary strands of either the tetrablock sequence or randomized sequence with equivalent number of cytosine or guanine nucleotides can form completely hybridized double helices. Even though the end states are the same for the two sequences, there exist multiple kinetic pathways that are populated with a wider range of transient aggregates of different sizes in the system of random sequences compared to that of the tetrablock sequence. The ability of these aggregates to undergo the strand displacement mechanism to form only double helices depends upon the temperature and DNA concentration. On one hand, low temperatures and high concentrations drive the formation and enhance stability of large aggregating species. On the other hand, high temperatures destabilize base-pair interactions and large aggregates. There exists an optimal range of moderate temperatures and low concentrations that allow minimization of large aggregate formation and maximization of fully hybridized dimers. Such investigation on structural dynamics of aggregating species by two closely related sequences during the self-assembly process demonstrates the importance of sequence design in avoiding the formation of metastable species. Finally, from kinetic modeling of self-assembly dynamics, the activation energy for the formation of double helices was found to be in agreement with experimental results. The framework developed in this work can be applied to the future design of DNA nanostructures in both fields of structural DNA nanotechnology and dynamic DNA nanotechnology wherein equilibrium end states and nonequilibrium dynamics are equally important requiring investigation in cooperation.},

@article{Markegard2015,
	Abstract = {A novel coarse-grained model is developed to elucidate thermodynamics and kinetic mechanisms of DNA self-assembly. It accounts for sequence and solvent conditions to capture key experimental results such as sequence-dependent thermal property and salt-dependent persistence length of ssDNA and dsDNA. Moreover, constant-temperature simulations on two single strands of a homogeneous sequence show two main mechanisms of hybridization: a slow slithering mechanism and a one-order faster zippering mechanism. Furthermore, large-scale simulations at a high DNA strand concentration demonstrate that DNA self-assembly is a robust and enthalpically driven process in which the formation of double helices is deciphered to occur via multiple self-assembly pathways including the strand displacement mechanism. However, sequence plays an important role in shifting the majority of one pathway over the others and controlling size distribution of self-assembled aggregates. This study yields a complex picture on the role of sequence on programmable self-assembly and demonstrates a promising simulation tool that is suitable for studies in DNA nanotechnology.},
